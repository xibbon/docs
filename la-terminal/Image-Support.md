La Terminal can render images produced by either the [sixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel) encoding system or using the [iTerm Image Extensions](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html).

You can use the various iTerm2 commands to integrate images into your workflow:

* [imgcat](https://iterm2.com/utilities/imgcat): displays images in the console
* [imgls](https://iterm2.com/utilities/imgls): list directory contents with image thumbnails
